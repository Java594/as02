Assignment 2 - Circles and Points

Part I
Write a “Circle” class
- Two methods to calculate its area and circumference
- A third method to find out if a given point is inside the circle

Write a “CircleApplication” class (separate .java file)
- Only a main() method
- Should create 5 circles, and a single point. It should output the following about each:
--Coordinates for its center
--Area
--Circumference
--If the point lies inside or outside the circle

Part II
Write a Point class
- Should have x and y coordinate values (only 2D)
Update the Circle and CircleApplication classes to make use of this Point class.
